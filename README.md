## Development Environment

> Important steps to take before you'll be able to contribute to this project.

1. Install Visual Studio Code.
2. Install all of the recommended extensions.
3. Install rust toolchain:

   > ```sh
   > rustup toolchain install stable
   > rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain stable
   > rustup component add llvm-tools-preview --toolchain stable
   > ```

4. Install the following cargo applications:

   > ```sh
   > cargo install cargo-watch
   > cargo install miniserve --locked
   > cargo install -f wasm-bindgen-cli
   > ```

> At this point you should be good to go.
> See [Developing](#developing) for launching, debugging and creation.

Note: If no tasks start, just start the miniserve task manually and then trash the task.
VSC will alert you of the available tasks and start them from then on automatically.

## Developing

> Visual Studio Code will automatically build and serve the web version of the game.

- Hitting F5 will run the game.
- Check the `Miniserve` terminal tab for the URL to view the game in the browser.
