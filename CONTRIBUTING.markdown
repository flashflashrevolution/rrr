# RRR Contributing Guidelines

## Reporting an Issue

- As much detail as possible.
- Record a video.
- Supply reproduction steps.

## Requesting a Feature

- Be supportive and link examples or sketches that elaborate on your idea. The more work you put in the more likely someone else is to work on it. Discuss your idea with people before you spend time working on it to avoid disapointment if the idea doesn't mesh.

## Making a Pull Request

- Make sure your code runs on native and web targets.
- Make sure auto formatting and linting has been working.
- Keep your changes as small as possible per PR. Huge PRs will be rejected unless discussed before contribution.
- Comment anywhere your variable, function, and struct names do not self document.
